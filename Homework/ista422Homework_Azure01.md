# Azure Fun. Ch 1, Cloud Basics
## Homework


##### 1. What are the differences between Iaas, Paas, and Saas?
* SaaS is software that is centrally hosted and managed for the end customer.
* With PaaS, you deploy your application into an application-hosting environment provided by the cloud service vendor.
* An IaaS cloud vendor runs and manages server farms running virtualization software, enabling you to create VMs that run on the vendorâ€™s infrastructure.


##### 2. What is the Azure Service Management (ASM) deployment model? What is the Resource Manager deployment model?
* Since it went into public preview, the Azure Service Management (ASM) deployment model has been used to deploy services. In the Azure portal, services managed with ASM are referred to as classic
* In 2015, Microsoft introduced the Resource Manager deployment model as a modern, more functional replacement for ASM.

##### 3. What is the difference between a control plane amd a data plane?
control planes are used to control services, not just to deploy them. This is different from a data plane, which manages the data used by a service.
##### 4. What is Role-Based Access Control?
provides fine-grained control over the operations and scope with which a user can perform a control-plant action.
##### 5. Why would you want to create a custom role for role-based access control?
If none of the built-in roles and no combination of the built-in roles provides exactly what you need, you can create a custom role.
##### 6. Consider the Azure portal. What is the dashboard? What is the hub? What is a blade?
* Dashboard- The area on the right with the tiles is called your Dashboard. You can customize this by adding tiles, removing tiles, resizing tiles, and so on by selecting Edit Dashboard.
* Hub- The column on the left is called a hub; it shows you a core set of options such as Resource Groups, All Resources, and Recent. The other items on this hub are resources you have selected and/or used before.
* Blade- The separate sections that get opened are called blades.

##### 7.Access the conceptual Azure documentation on Github. Search the documentation and answer this question: What happens when I reach the spending limit?
If you exceed the credit amount, your service will be disabled until the next month starts. You can turn off the spending limit and add a credit card to be used for the additional costs.
##### 8. Access the Azure samples on Github. Search for an example that will allow you to download an Azure invoice. Copy the source code to your discussion. (This is Program.cs.)

##### 9. Access the Azure Resource Manager samples on Github. Search for a quickstart template that will allow you to set up a free SQL Database for a web application. This template has four files. One file is a markdown file. What is the type of the other three files?
.json
